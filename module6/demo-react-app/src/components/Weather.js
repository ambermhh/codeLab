// State can be modified based on user action or network changes
// Every time the state of an object changes, React re-renders the component to the browser
// The state object is initialized in the constructor
// The state object can store multiple properties
// this.setState() is used to change the value of the state object
// setState() function performs a shallow merge between the new and the previous state
// State shouldn’t be modified directly – the setState( ) should be used
// State affects the performance of your app, and therefore it shouldn’t be used unnecessarily
